I am a senior year student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee currently pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering. I have been working with software for the past 4 years and have made some projects, a few of which are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/divijbindlish).

I am an avid reader of HackerNews and regularly follow the latest developments in science, technology, business and economy.

Member of [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co), an awesome student group constantly striving to innovate and foster technical activities @IITR.
